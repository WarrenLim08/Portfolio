									<h1>About Me<br />
									</h1>
									<p>Just a UC Berkeley Data Science Alumni who creates apps and websites for fun,<br />
                                    while career searching for Computer and Data Science roles.<br />

                                <h2>Background</h2>
								<p>I grew up in the San Fernando Valley where I graduated from James Monroe High School as a Valedictorian. I studied Data Science and got involved in research projects at the University of California, Berkeley. At Berkeley, I joined Code For Good where I worked with non-profit organizations to positively impact communities through technology solutions like web-projects.
                                    We collaborated with OneSky, an organization that provides responsive care and safe learning environments to children, to redesign their website. <br><br>

                                    I previously worked as a Data Analyst Intern at Talino Venture Labs where I practiced growth marketing, demographic research to understand targeted customers, and MixPanel data analysis on users' financial activity (remittances and transactions). 
                                    In addition, I learned about how business campaigns worked and how to create Google and Facebook advertisements. I analyzed conversion data from those ads to better understand potential customer engagement. <br><br>
                                    
                                    After graduating, I started my own side business known as So Full Circle, a 360 Photo Booth Rental Service. I created the company website for people to make reservations for my photo booth services. Ever since the company's establishment, I've provided my services to many events such as weddings, Christmas parties, and corporate gatherings. <br><br>
                                    
                                    Just recently, I finished developing a department search directory app for the employees at Cedars Sinai Medical Center so they can easily find the department name and extension number they are looking for.</p>
